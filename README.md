The Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Air and Water Database (AWDB) has recently stood up a REST API to serve it's data to the general public. 
The documentation page can be found [here](https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/awdbRestApi/swagger-ui/index.html), this demo was created for an [Internet of Water](https://internetofwater.org/) webinar on June 4th, 2024. 
By studying this demo a user should be able to harness the AWDB REST API for a multitude of hydrological analyses.

A python notebook and script are provided for review and if possible a link to thet webinar will be added here at a later date. 

The code relies on the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/getting_started.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) python libraries.
Though without knowledge of these libraries the code provided should still show a basic level of how one might obtain data from the API and prepare it for use in a different analysis.
